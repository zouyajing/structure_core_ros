# structure_core_ros

Folked from https://github.com/chadrockey/structure_core_ros. Additional IMU topic is published.

The motivation is to use it as the device for RGB-D and inertial sensor fusion. However, the quality is not good enough: 1. poor color image and unstable IMU frequency; 2. no time sync between IMU and cameras.

Follow the instructions in https://github.com/chadrockey/structure_core_ros to build and run.
